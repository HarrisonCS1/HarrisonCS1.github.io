## Music

<h1 style="color:#FF7A00; font-size:16px;">Live EDM Performer</h1>

Inspired by classic trance and house styles, I perform live hardware-based electronic dance music, utilizing synthesizers, sequencers, and drum machines on the fly. Much of my EDM performance is heavily improvised and while I may utilize looping and pattern sequencing, everything is original (or in the case of covers, crafted by hand akin to a cover band recreating an original song.) 

I am not a DJ, and what I do is not DJing. If you'd like to learn more, please reach out.

<h1 style="color:#900000; font-size:16px;">Scarlet Fever Keyboardist</h1>

I'm keyboardist for Charlottesville-based band Scarlet Fever. We play covers of popular songs from the past 50 years for events ranging from house shows and fraternity parites to local bars and university events. If you're interested in booking us or would like to learn more, please reach out and check out the link below.

As our band's keyboardist, I believe that it's my role to support the rest of the band while retaining my own unique musical character. I embrace a highly improvised pop-rock style of playing influenced by blues and early rock-n-roll as well as contemporary pop and sound synthesis techniques, which allows me to remain flexible and adapt to a variety of musical genres. 

A performance video is hopefully coming soon.

In the meantime, check out the band <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scarletfevercville/">here</a>.
