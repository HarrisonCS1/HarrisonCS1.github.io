<h1 style="color:#900000; font-size:16px;">Scarlet Fever Keyboardist</h1>

I'm keyboardist for Charlottesville-based band Scarlet Fever. We play covers of popular songs from the past 50 years for events ranging from house shows and fraternity parites to local bars and university events. If you're interested in booking us or would like to learn more, please reach out and check out the link below.

As our band's keyboardist, I believe that it's the role of the keyboard to support the rest of the band while retaining its own unique musical character. I embrace a highly improvised pop-rock style of playing influenced by blues and early rock-n-roll as well as contemporary pop and sound synthesis techniques, which allows me to remain flexible and adapt to a variety of musical genres. 

A performance video is hopefully coming soon.

In the meantime, check out the band <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scarletfevercville/">here</a>.
